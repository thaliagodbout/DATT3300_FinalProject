# Deathly Troves
This is a rough game prototype for DATT 3300 Game Mechanics.

Long ago, an identical city was built underneath Eusapia where the dead could carry on living. The Hooded Brothers, the only ones that walk both worlds, say that the dead make many life-improving innovations in their city – the living, growing obsessed with keeping up, have taken to copying the novelties of the dead in their own world.

As a trusted member of the City Council, you’ve been tasked with making improvements in the city. Deathly Troves is a puzzle game based on Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities where you travel to the underworld to discover what secret shenanigans the dead are up to and replicate them in the living city.
